### Project Title
Explore US bikeshare data

### Description
The project "Explore US Bikeshare Data" is about analyzing and exploring data related to bike share systems in three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The goal of the project is to use Python programming skills to import the data, compute descriptive statistics, and answer interesting questions about the bike share data.

The project involves the following key steps:

    Importing the data: The project requires importing the data files for each city, which contain information about bike share trips, such as start time, end time, trip duration, and user type.

    Data wrangling: The data from the three cities may have different formats and structures. The project involves cleaning and unifying the data to ensure consistency and ease of analysis.

    Computing descriptive statistics: The project requires calculating various statistics, such as the most common start station, the average trip duration, and the distribution of trips by user type.

    Answering analysis questions: The project prompts you to pose interesting questions about the data and use the computed statistics to answer them. For example, you could explore the differences in bike usage patterns between subscribers and casual customers.

    Creating visualizations: The project encourages you to create visualizations to better understand the data and communicate your findings. For example, you could create histograms to visualize the distribution of trip durations for different user types.

    Interactive experience: As an additional challenge, the project suggests creating an interactive experience in the terminal, where users can input their preferences and get specific information about the bike share data.
